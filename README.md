# Written Analysis of Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit

In module three, a report on a congressional election audit, involving the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each
candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote, was created 
and submitted to the election commission.

In this analysis, some additional data; including the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county 
out of the total count, and the total county with the highest turnout, was demanded by the commission to complete the audit.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can easily be used in the future elections by application of some modifications on the code, following the alterations on the new resource data 
including the name of counties, candidates, the number of votes and equivalent percentages. Using this code as a starter code in the future projects could 
significantly shorten the duration of analyzing process, which would end up for the benefit of the election commission financially and for the voters,  
time-efficiently. With due regard, consideration of this work for the possible future projects is highly appreciated.
